# SwitchML Configuration file
# This is where you can configure all SwitchML options.
# SwitchML looks for and parses this configuration file as soon as
# you start the context (unless you pass a Config object to its Start function).
# It looks for it in the following order:
#   1- /etc/switchml.config
#   2- ./switchml.config
#   3- ./switchml-<hostname>.config  (Ex. ./switchml-node12.config)

# General options.

#
# This number is divided between worker threads.
# This means that each worker thread will first send its initial
# burst up to this number divided by num_worker_threads. Then sends new packets only after packets are received
# doing this until all packets have been sent.
# If you have this set to 256 and num_worker_threads set to 8 then each worker thread will send up to 32 packets.
